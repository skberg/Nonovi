# Nonovi


This is a short explanation about Nonovi and what it is. Nonovi is in all regards a work project that I made. 

The thought behind this task was to generate an iPad looking devise that works and contained a web-based app inside of this iPad. All of the elements you see in front of you are made using styling and normal html. This task will probably be re-worked on a later date where I want to make it in to a phone size maybe, and also use a js framework to make it easier for me. This was in all regards a test to see if it was possible to design it and get it to work inside the tablet. 

This is a none-responsive web page, so to get the full experience I suggest you to use a desktop or laptop to view the pages. If you are interested to see what I used I have added some buttons below that will lead you to the doc of all the technology. 

To get in to the app you will need to navigate you mouse to the “n” icon on the bottom element inside the iPad and click on it, then you will be taken to the app itself. 

Under you will find some of the tech used in this project 

- SCSS
- JS
- JASON
- HTML
